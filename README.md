This is project Wordle (but in Java).

The team consists of myself, Marco Orallo.

What I'm trying to build is a replica of wordle, I want to build it because it seems simple enough but has complex features that are difficult to find when it comes to other projects which helps make the project seem unique. I plan on this program to be used for entertainment purposes and a project to help me learn more about Java.

The plan is to work slowly and gain information on the structure of Wordle, the effort is 90% on me and the rest is up to online resources and friends that are knowledgeable about coding to give me pointers.
