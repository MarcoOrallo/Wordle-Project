# Wordle (But in Java)

## Purpose:
This is Project Wordle (but in Java).

What I'm trying to build is a replica of Wordle, I want to build it because it seems simple enough but has complex features that are difficult to find when it comes to other projects which helps make the project seem unique. I plan on this program to be used for entertainment purposes and a project to help me learn more about Java.

The plan is to work slowly and gain information on the structure of Wordle, the effort is 70% on me and the rest is up to online resources and friends who are knowledgeable about coding to give me pointers.

## What is Wordle:
My program is based off of the popular web browser game Wordle that was published by the New York Times. The premise of Wordle is to guess a randomly generated 5-letter word in which you have six guesses to get right. As you guess words, the program gives you hints by color-coding the letter either black, green, or yellow to indicate whether the letter in the word you guessed is in the randomly generated word that you are trying to guess. Black means the letter isn't in the word, yellow means the letter is in the word but not in the right place, and green means that the letter is in the word and in the right spot. The game ends if you either go through all 6 guesses without getting the word or you guess the word before the six tries.
## How to run:

1) Install everything you see in the GitHub repository and ensure you have both .txt files and the source code.
2) Since the entirety of the GUI is in Java Swing, you should be able to simply hit run and the application will load on your screen.
3) Once opened, you will be prompted to type a valid 5-letter word (Valid meaning a real 5-letter dictionary word).
4) Once you have typed your word, press enter on your keyboard or the button that says "enter" in the window.
5) You will notice that a letter in the word you have inputted is either black, yellow, or green. Black means that the letter isn't present in the generated word, yellow means the letter is present but not in the right place, and green means the letter is present in the word and in the right spot.
6) The game ends when you either guess the word before you run out of tries or you run out of tries guessing the word.
